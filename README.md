# Threads
* Implementation of  a multi-threaded matrix multiplication program. 
* The inputs to the program are two matrixes A(x*y) and B(y*z) that are read from corresponding files. 
* The output is a matrix C(x*z) that is written to an output file. 
* A parallelized version of matrix multiplication can be done using one of these two methods: 
    1. A thread computes each row in the output C matrix. 
    2. A thread computes each element in the output C matrix.
